## Physical quantities and units

An engineering quantity consists of a numerical value and a unit.

For example:

```text
2.4 GHz
```

contains:

* Numerical value: `2.4`
* Unit: `GHz`
* Physical quantity: frequency

A number without a unit is often incomplete or ambiguous.

For example, the value:

```text
10
```

could mean:

* 10 hertz
* 10 seconds
* 10 metres
* 10 watts
* 10 decibels

For this reason, variable names should communicate the expected unit.

```python
frequency_hz = 2.4e9
distance_m = 1_000.0
power_w = 5.0
time_s = 0.25
```

The suffixes `_hz`, `_m`, `_w`, and `_s` indicate the units associated with the variables.

---

## SI prefixes

Engineering calculations frequently use SI prefixes.

| Prefix | Symbol |     Scale | Python notation |
| ------ | -----: | --------: | --------------: |
| giga   |      G |    $10^9$ |           `1e9` |
| mega   |      M |    $10^6$ |           `1e6` |
| kilo   |      k |    $10^3$ |           `1e3` |
| milli  |      m | $10^{-3}$ |          `1e-3` |
| micro  |      µ | $10^{-6}$ |          `1e-6` |
| nano   |      n | $10^{-9}$ |          `1e-9` |

Capitalization matters.

For example:

* `MHz` means megahertz.
* `mHz` means millihertz.

These two units differ by a factor of $10^9$.

---

## Scientific notation in Python

Engineering values can be extremely large or extremely small.

Python uses `e` notation to represent powers of ten.

```python
one_thousand = 1e3
one_million = 1e6
one_billion = 1e9

one_thousandth = 1e-3
one_millionth = 1e-6
one_billionth = 1e-9
```

The expression:

```python
2.4e9
```

represents:

$$
2.4 \times 10^9
$$

Similarly:

```python
1e-6
```

represents:

$$
1 \times 10^{-6}
$$

---

## Digit separators

Python allows underscores inside long numerical values.

The following two values are identical:

```python
2400000000
2_400_000_000
```

Digit separators improve readability but do not change the numerical value.

For engineering code, the second form is often easier to inspect.

---

## Frequency

Frequency describes the number of cycles completed per second.

The SI unit of frequency is the hertz:

$$
1\ \text{Hz} = 1\ \text{cycle per second}
$$

Common RF frequency units include:

| Unit  | Equivalent value |
| ----- | ---------------: |
| 1 kHz |        $10^3$ Hz |
| 1 MHz |        $10^6$ Hz |
| 1 GHz |        $10^9$ Hz |

For example:

$$
2.4\ \text{GHz}
===============

2.4 \times 10^9\ \text{Hz}
$$

In Python:

```python
frequency_ghz = 2.4
frequency_hz = frequency_ghz * 1e9
```

---

## Signal period

The period of a signal is the time required to complete one cycle.

Period and frequency are related by:

$$
T = \frac{1}{f}
$$

where:

* $T$ is the period in seconds
* $f$ is the frequency in hertz

For a signal with a frequency of $1\ \text{MHz}$:

$$
f = 1 \times 10^6\ \text{Hz}
$$

Therefore:

$$
T
=

# \frac{1}{1 \times 10^6}

1 \times 10^{-6}\ \text{s}
$$

The period is:

$$
T = 1\ \mu\text{s}
$$

In Python:

```python
frequency_hz = 1e6
period_s = 1 / frequency_hz
```

---

## Dimensional check for period

A dimensional check confirms that the equation produces the expected unit.

Frequency has units of inverse seconds:

$$
[f] = \text{s}^{-1}
$$

Therefore:

$$
[T]
===

# \frac{1}{\text{s}^{-1}}

\text{s}
$$

The result correctly has units of time.

---

## Free-space wavelength

Wavelength is the physical distance occupied by one complete cycle of a wave.

For an electromagnetic wave travelling through vacuum:

$$
\lambda = \frac{c}{f}
$$

where:

* $\lambda$ is wavelength in metres
* $c$ is propagation speed in metres per second
* $f$ is frequency in hertz

The exact defined value of the speed of light in vacuum is:

$$
c = 299,792,458\ \text{m/s}
$$

In Python:

```python
speed_of_light_m_per_s = 299_792_458.0
frequency_hz = 2.4e9

wavelength_m = speed_of_light_m_per_s / frequency_hz
```

---

## Dimensional check for wavelength

The units of propagation speed are metres per second:

$$
[c] = \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}
$$

The units of frequency are inverse seconds:

$$
[f] = \text{s}^{-1}
$$

Therefore:

$$
[\lambda]
=========

# \frac{\text{m/s}}{\text{s}^{-1}}

\text{m}
$$

The calculated result correctly has units of distance.

---

## Hand calculation

Calculate the wavelength of a $2.4\ \text{GHz}$ signal.

First convert the frequency to hertz:

$$
f = 2.4 \times 10^9\ \text{Hz}
$$

Use the approximate value:

$$
c \approx 3.0 \times 10^8\ \text{m/s}
$$

Apply the wavelength equation:

$$
\lambda = \frac{c}{f}
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
\lambda
=======

\frac{3.0 \times 10^8}
{2.4 \times 10^9}
$$

Therefore:

$$
\lambda = 0.125\ \text{m}
$$

Convert metres to centimetres:

$$
0.125\ \text{m} = 12.5\ \text{cm}
$$

The approximate wavelength of a $2.4\ \text{GHz}$ signal is therefore:

$$
\boxed{\lambda \approx 0.125\ \text{m}}
$$

---

## Relationship between frequency and wavelength

Wavelength is inversely proportional to frequency:

$$
\lambda \propto \frac{1}{f}
$$

This means:

* Doubling frequency halves wavelength.
* Multiplying frequency by 10 divides wavelength by 10.
* Halving frequency doubles wavelength.
* Dividing frequency by 10 multiplies wavelength by 10.

This relationship is important in:

* Antenna design
* RF propagation
* Radar
* Satellite communications
* Satellite navigation
* Waveguides
* Transmission lines
* Remote sensing
