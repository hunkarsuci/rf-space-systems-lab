[![Notebook CI](https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY/actions/workflows/notebook-ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/hunkarsuci/rf-space-systems-lab/blob/main/.github/workflows/notebook-ci.yml)

# RF Space Systems Lab

A structured Python learning and engineering laboratory covering:

- RF engineering
- Signals and digital signal processing
- Antennas and propagation
- Radar
- Orbital mechanics
- Satellite communications
- Satellite navigation
- Integrated RF and space-system simulations

This repository documents the progression from engineering fundamentals to reusable, tested simulation software.

> **Repository principle:** notebooks explain and experiment, Python modules implement reusable engineering logic, and tests verify correctness.

## Project objectives

The project is designed to develop both theoretical understanding and practical engineering capability.

Each major topic should include:

1. Mathematical derivation
2. Physical interpretation
3. Units and dimensional analysis
4. Hand-worked examples
5. Python implementation
6. Numerical experiments
7. Visualization
8. Verification against known results
9. Automated tests
10. Assumptions, limitations, and engineering discussion
11. Technical references
12. A final design or simulation project

The target is graduate-level technical depth and disciplined software-development practice. This is an independent learning project, not an accredited degree program.

## Repository structure

The repository will grow incrementally. New lesson directories should be added when work on them begins rather than creating many empty folders in advance.

## Lesson standard

Every lesson should follow a consistent engineering structure.

### 1. Learning objectives

State what the learner should be able to explain, calculate, implement, test, and interpret.

### 2. Theory

Introduce the physical model and derive the relevant equations. Define every symbol and unit.

For example:

\[
T = \frac{1}{f}
\]

\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f}
\]

where:

- \(T\) is period in seconds
- \(f\) is frequency in hertz
- \(\lambda\) is wavelength in metres
- \(c\) is propagation speed in metres per second

### 3. Hand calculation

Complete at least one numerical example before writing code.

### 4. Python implementation

Start with a clear implementation in the lesson notebook. Move stable and reusable functions into:

```text
src/rf_space_systems/
```

### 5. Visualization

Plot relationships that improve engineering understanding, such as:

- Wavelength versus frequency
- Noise power versus bandwidth
- Free-space path loss versus distance
- Radar received power versus range
- Link margin versus elevation angle
- GNSS geometry versus positioning error

### 6. Engineering experiments

Vary parameters, predict the effect, and compare the prediction with the computed result.

### 7. Verification

Use assertions initially and `pytest` as reusable modules develop.

```python
from rf_space_systems.rf import frequency_to_wavelength

assert frequency_to_wavelength(299_792_458.0) == 1.0
```

### 8. Engineering conclusions

Summarize the principal relationships, assumptions, sensitivities, and practical implications.

## Software architecture

The project separates explanation, reusable implementation, and verification.

```text
Lesson notebooks
    Explain theory, derivations, examples, and experiments

src/rf_space_systems/
    Contains reusable engineering functions and simulation components

tests/
    Verifies numerical behavior, units, limits, and reference cases
```

Example:

```text
03_rf_fundamentals/03_db_dbm_dbw/lesson.ipynb
src/rf_space_systems/units.py
tests/test_units.py
```

---

## Initial lesson

The first planned lesson is:

```text
00_engineering_python/
└── 01_numbers_units_scientific_notation/
    └── lesson.ipynb
```

It will introduce Python numeric fundamentals through:

- Frequency
- Period
- Distance
- Wavelength
- Time
- Power
- Scientific notation
- SI prefixes
- Unit conversion

---

## Planned capstone projects

```text
projects/
├── project01_rf_calculator/
├── project02_signal_processing_lab/
├── project03_antenna_propagation_tool/
├── project04_radar_simulator/
├── project05_orbit_pass_predictor/
├── project06_satcom_link_designer/
└── project07_gnss_receiver_simulator/
```

Mature capstones may later become independent portfolio repositories:

- `rf-link-budget-tool`
- `radar-range-doppler-simulator`
- `satellite-pass-predictor`
- `satcom-link-design-tool`
- `gnss-positioning-simulator`

## Engineering conventions

### Units

- Use SI units internally unless a model explicitly requires another convention.
- State units in variable names, docstrings, tables, and plots when ambiguity is possible.
- Convert user-facing units at system boundaries.
- Perform dimensional checks during derivations and reviews.

### Numerical work

- Document constants and their sources.
- State model assumptions.
- Check limiting cases.
- Compare results with hand calculations or published reference values.
- Use tolerances for floating-point tests.

### Code quality

- Use type hints for reusable functions.
- Write docstrings that describe equations, parameters, units, and return values.
- Keep notebooks readable and reproducible.
- Avoid copying reusable logic across notebooks.
- Add tests whenever code moves into `src/`.

---

## Git workflow

Use descriptive commits that identify the engineering contribution.

Good examples:

```text
Add frequency period and wavelength fundamentals
Implement and test decibel conversion functions
Add free-space path-loss parameter study
Implement pulsed-radar range equation
```

Avoid vague messages such as:

```text
update
changes
fix
```

Suggested phase tags:

```bash
git tag -a python-foundations-v1 -m "Complete engineering Python foundations"
git tag -a rf-foundations-v1 -m "Complete RF foundations phase"
git tag -a dsp-foundations-v1 -m "Complete DSP foundations phase"
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for branch, commit, testing, and review conventions.

## Repository status

This repository is under active development. Immediate priorities are:

- Establish the expanded RF and space-systems identity
- Implement the first engineering-Python lesson
- Create the reusable package foundation
- Add initial unit tests
- Build the curriculum incrementally
- Preserve technical references and engineering assumptions

---

## Scope note

Radar is not inherently a space-system discipline. It is included because it shares the repository's RF, signal-processing, antenna, propagation, detection, and estimation foundations.
